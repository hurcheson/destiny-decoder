Understanding your Personal Year is like having a weather forecast for your life—it doesn't control what happens, but it helps you dress appropriately and plan wisely."

      "body": "Your **Personal Year number** is calculated by adding your birth month and day to the current calendar year, then reducing to a single digit (1-9). This number changes every year on your birthday, not on January 1st, and describes the predominant energy, themes, and opportunities you'll encounter during that twelve-month period.\n\nThink of Personal Years as seasons of your soul. Just as nature has spring for planting, summer for growth, autumn for harvest, and winter for rest, your life moves through nine distinct \"seasons\" that repeat throughout your lifetime. Each Personal Year has its own rhythm, and success comes from aligning your actions with the current year's energy rather than fighting against it."

Each cycle builds on previous ones, taking you deeper into mastery of life's rhythms.
