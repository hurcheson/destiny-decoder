Your heart is wired to care, to fix what's broken, to ensure everyone is taken care of and treated fairly. Your soul selected the vibration of 6 because this lifetime is about mastering unconditional love—learning to give from genuine caring rather than codependent need, and discovering that you, too, deserve the nurturing you so freely offer others."

      "body": "The number 6 represents **love, responsibility, harmony, and service**. As a Life Seal 6, you're naturally drawn to care for others—family, friends, community, even strangers. You're the person who notices when someone is struggling and immediately thinks, \"How can I help?\" You're most fulfilled when you're creating harmony, beauty, and wellbeing for those around you.\n\nYou have strong values around fairness, justice, and doing the right thing. When you perceive injustice or suffering, you feel compelled to correct it. This can make you a fierce advocate for those who can't advocate for themselves—children, animals, the vulnerable, the oppressed.\n\nYou're the person people come to when life gets hard. You listen without judgment, offer wise counsel, provide practical support, and create safe space for others to be vulnerable. Your home is likely a sanctuary—comfortable, beautiful, and welcoming to all who enter."

Saying no to what depletes you creates capacity to say yes to what matters.\n\n**Allow Others to Grow**: Understanding that constantly rescuing people can prevent their growth. Sometimes the most loving thing is to let others face consequences and develop their own strength.\n\n**Release Perfection**: Learning to embrace \"good enough\" and accepting that harmony doesn't require everyone to meet your exacting standards."

Different doesn't mean wrong—it's just different.\n\n4. **Receive Gracefully**: Learn to accept help, support, and care from others. Your willingness to receive teaches others how to give and allows reciprocity.\n\n5. **Choose Your Causes Wisely**: You can't save everyone or fix everything.
